Here I tried using same commands as level 0 but didn't work same as earlier by reading referneced links got to know that if just use the "-" command line thinks that I am trying type a command.

level 3

In this level I have no idea about the ". .. " part. Later I figure it out that they indicate current folder and current folder and .file means a hidden file

level 4

In this level I used "ls -l" command but all the files listed are same in size and not executable so to check whcih one is the human readable file I have to use the "file" command

level 5 

At first I thought since I am in the inhere folder the find command will find the relevant file in the cureent folder so I didn't use "." thing.Then realsed I have to use it.
